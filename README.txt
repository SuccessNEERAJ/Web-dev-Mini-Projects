This is my Web development based Mini projects marathon where i will upload 100 projects in 100 days and going to learn more about HTML, CSS and JavaScript through projects based approach. Each folder contains a mini project. These projects are taken from sahandghavidel repository (https://github.com/sahandghavidel/HTML-CSS-JavaScript-projects-for-beginners) to learn from these projects. A big thanks to sahandghavidel for providing such a good repository for us to learn a lot on HTML, CSS and javaScript
